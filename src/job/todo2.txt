Follow SOLID principles

SSR/SSG for public pages using Next.js


📉 6. Reduce Chrome Load/Dev Machine Strain

Use DevTools Performance tab to identify bottlenecks

Limit number of console logs / Dev overlays

Avoid memory leaks in long-running tabs

Unload heavy components in background tabs

Avoid huge localStorage/sessionStorage usage

Use Chrome extensions like “Performance Monitor”



📊 7. Make Code Senior-Developer Friendly
Goal: Impress your tech leads/senior devs

Follow naming conventions

Split large files (>300 lines) into smaller modules

Use JSDoc or TypeScript types for every function

Avoid magic numbers / hardcoded strings – extract constants

Clear commit messages, Git hygiene

Comment only where logic is non-obvious

Error boundaries to catch runtime issues

Strict error handling – don't ignore errors in API calls

Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices

Monitor performance with tools like Lighthouse, Web Vitals
